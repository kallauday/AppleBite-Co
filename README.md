AppleBite Co. is using Cloud for one of their products. The project uses modular components, 
multiple frameworks and want the components to be developed by different teams or by 3rd-party 
vendors. 

The company’s goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production with High quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce feedback time between developers and testers. 

As development progressed, they are facing multiple problems, because of various technologies 
involved in the project. Following are the problems:

• Building Complex builds is difficult
• Manual efforts to test various components/modules of the project
• Incremental builds are difficult to manage, test and deploy

To solve these problems, they need to implement Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment 
with DevOps using following tools: 

# Git – For version control for tracking changes in the code files

# Jenkins – For continuous integration and continuous deployment

# Docker – For deploying containerized applications

# Puppet/Ansible - Configuration management tools

# Selenium - For automating tests on the deployed web application

This project will be about how to do deploy code to dev/stage/prod etc, just on a click of button.
